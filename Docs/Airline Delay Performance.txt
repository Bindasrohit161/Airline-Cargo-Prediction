Airmline Cargo (Freight) Prediction
========================================

Airlines around the world boosted air cargo capacity in response to global transportation needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. With global supply chain challenges easing and recovery of long-haul
international passenger networks progressing, the industry is now shifting focus to the evolving needs of air cargo demand and networks in the post-pandemic years ahead.

Air cargo traffic is predicted to drop by a further 4% next year, while yields and revenues are also expected to weaken compared with this year’s levels.

Speaking at the IATA Global Media Day, the airline association’s head of policy analysis Andrew Matters revealed its predictions for next year.

Problem Statement
========================================

The air cargo transportation system is a large and complex service system, 
in which demand forecasting is a key element in the master planning process.
Demand forecasting is essential for analyzing existing cargo flight 
schedules and identifying future facility requirements of air cargo companies.



Business Goals
========================================
The revenue of commercial airlines is primarily derived from sales
of passenger tickets and cargo (freight) shipments. While most modern 
airlines have implemented sophisticated data-driven passenger
revenue management systems, for cargo the situation is different.
The air-cargo ecosystem is complex and involves several players
including shippers, freight forwarders, airline- and end-customers.

Expected Results
==================
 It is well known that cargo capacity is often volume-constrained,
i.e., the aircraft will reach volume capacity before it reaches weight
capacity. However, this makes things even harder because the volume
 measurements are less accurate than the weight ones. 

Solution
========================================
Due to these major differences, air-cargo business requires not
only to accurately predict the quantity (weight and volume) of an
item that will be tendered but also to make decisions on whether
to accept or reject a booking for a certain flight. This will enable
the airline to greatly increase the efficiency of capacity utilization.
However, prediction and decision-making in an air-cargo setting
is non-trivial because of three main reasons


Steps
------
Feature Engineering & cleaning
---------------------------------------
In this transformation we have developed certain features like centrailities of their routs aggregation of their counts and 
as well we have taken care of data dreafting with time and removed outliers or skewed data.
Morever, Transform counts of Passangers in average weights (avg customer weight is 68 Kg) and combined weight of Passangers,
Freights and Mails to see max capacity of the airline and with research found the average internationa flights has maximam passangers
capacity are 450. SO, calculated number of airline in the respected routs with respecte to total pasangers count, and so on...

Regression model training
-------------------------

Morever, Data feature engioneering and cleaning then we have optimized feature selection with Shapley and then
trained data with Randome forest with indepth grid search. so, our moidel can use most effective features with 
resepect to their weights.



 
Technical Requirements (Libraries, Environment configs)
=======================================================

We have used below Libraries-

* Sklearn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Math
* Sscipy
* Random Forest Regression
* Networkx

* We have used CPU_LARGE envtype
